You'll typically need to provide personal details like your name, email address, social security number if necessary in the United States, and payment information.\\n\\n4. **Deadlines**: Be aware of course registration deadlines which can vary from one institution to another or between different courses offered within the same platform (Coursera often has a specific start date for each term).
